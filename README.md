# fby-2017-workshop

My f(by) 2017 workshop on building Telegram bots in Haskell.

## Preparing for the workshop

See [preparation instructions](INSTALL.md) to get ready for the workshop ahead of time!
It is still possible to set up everything at the workshop, but it can steal some time
and leave you with less time to play around :)
